# TrajectoryMergeAssist
A python based GUI tool that helps in merging two sequential trajectories on Desmond MD (molecular dynamics). This is a very useful tool for Bioinformaticians that makes it easier to work with different trajectories generated via extended molecular dynamics simulations on Desmond.

Key features:

1. Works with both the latest and older versions of Desmond.

2. Generates -out.cms ready for use in Maestro if Desmond version is 2018.1 or later.

Contributions are most welcome for further improvements and including other molecular dynamics formats to make it universal.
