# TrajectoryMergeAssist
A python based GUI tool that helps in merging two trajectories on Desmond MD (molecular dynamics)

Key features:

1. Merges trajectories irrespective of Desmond version being old or new (2018.1)

2. Generates -out.cms ready for use in Maestro if Desmond version is 2018.1 or later

Contributions welcome for including other molecular dynamics formats to make it universal
